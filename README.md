# Flexcel 
Flexcel is a debate strategizing software for competitive high school debaters
at state and national level tournaments. 

## Tech Stack
Flexcel is a web-app built with JavaScript, jQuery and packaged into a desktop environment
with Electron. 
### Libraries
1. Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/)
2. Handsontable (https://handsontable.com/)
3. Textbox.io (https://www.textbox.io/)

# Flexcel Cloud
Flexcel Cloud is the next stage in the development of Flexcel. The overarching objective 
is to host Flexcel on the cloud, which will allow for anywhere access, more scalability,
access to cloud computing resources, etc.

# Open-Source Objectives
The fundamental shift from Flexcel to Flexcel Cloud is in the tech stack. For the frontend, it is rewriting jQuery code to React. For the backend, it is hosting the app on the cloud, instead of the  Microsoft and Apple Store.

Here are the following objectives
- Authentication (Login, SignUp)
- Dashboard 
- Migrate features from jQuery to React
  - [x] Tab Navigation
